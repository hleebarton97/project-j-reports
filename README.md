### Cloning and Installation
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/hleebarton97/project-j-reports.git
$ cd project-j-reports
$ npm install
```
Run `npm run dev` to make sure it is working.

### Before Making Changes
Make sure to create a new branch: `git checkout -b topic-myNewFeature`
When you're done:
```
git status
git add .
git commit -m "feature: description of new feature"
git push origin topic-myNewFeature
```
It is important to create a new branch if we are making changes,
so that merging is as easy as possible.
